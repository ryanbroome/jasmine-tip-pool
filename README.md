<b>There is one test that keeps failing occasionally<br>
"TypeError: Cannot read prop of undefined (reading 'billAmt') payments.test.js:19:40)"</b><br>
<i>This exercise was good practice but made me feel like I need a lot more practice with backend .js with the structuring of functions and layout of data. In other words I would have really struggled to create this app from the ground up.</i>
